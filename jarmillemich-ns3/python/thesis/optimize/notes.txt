The perfect trajectory representation:
  is realistic (no cusping, low dv changes of speed/direction)
  doesn't wander from the origin
  can express "fancier" trajectories than just circles or oblate circles, like our bowtie
  can express nonlinear z-scheduling
  can express non-uniform topologies
    e.g. circular in the morning, bowtie in the evening, whatever else at night


Fourier XY scheduling?



Reasons things aren't as interesting:
  Bandwidth is basically reduced to a function of height, when we have small stations relative to the user distrib
    If we target minimum throughput, we want to be at the centroid of the most distant users
    If we target maximum throughput, we want to be above the most active user (boring)
    If we target average throughput, we want to be at the centroid of the users

  If we have multiple UAVs, we reduce back to the cell pattern, most likely
